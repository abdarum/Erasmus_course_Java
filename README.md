# AOOP and PIT projects
## Short description
Advanced object-oriented programming(AOOP) and Programing and Internet technologies(PIT) are courses that contains common modules as:
* Database implementation (PostGres, Oracle, MS SQL, My SQL) - Relational schema table description
* Implementation of the database layer (DAO (JDBC), JPA (Hibernate))
* Implementation of a module for logging events in the system - log4J

Result of AOOP project is desktop application 
* Implementation of business logic and graphical interface - Java, JavaFX

Result of PIT project is desktop application 
* Implementation of business logic and graphical interface 
    * Java, 
    * Java Web (Werver side - Servlet, JSP, Client side – HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
        * Web server with Java web container – Apache Tomcat, Jetty
    * Possible using of Spring or ActiveJ frameworks
 * Notes:
   - Communication should be bidirectional. [Differences between SSE and WebSocket](https://medium.com/better-programming/server-sent-events-on-react-and-spring-webflux-5f532b04633)
